“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”
“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.
“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”`,
            `“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where–” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
“–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”`,
`Who are YOU?” said the Caterpillar.
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. 
Alice replied, rather shyly, “I–I hardly know, sir, just at present– at 
least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, 
but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”`,
        `“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that is–
‘Be what you would seem to be’–or if you’d like it put more simply–
‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what 
you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared 
to them to be otherwise.'”
“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely, 
“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”
“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.
“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said Alice.`
