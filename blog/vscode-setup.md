I get asked many times a week which theme, font and setup I have with VS Code. So here are the links..

## Theme

The theme is [Noctis Minimus](https://vscodethemes.com/e/liviuschera.noctis/noctis-minimus?language=python) in the Noctis theme extension. In VS Code you can just change the theme and type "Noctius Minimum" and it will download the extension for you.

## Font

I'm using two fonts in VS Code. My editor font is [Comic Mono](https://dtinth.github.io/comic-mono-font/).

My Terminal font is [Meslo with NerdFont Ligatures for PowerLine](https://github.com/kgraefe/meslo-lgsn-patched/raw/main/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf).

Check out [programmingfonts.org](https://programmingfonts.org) for a nice collection of alternatives.

## Terminal

My terminal is [Oh-My-Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/) on macOS configured with my own theme (tonybaloney). It shows the version of Python activated in the shell.
